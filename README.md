Previous development teams input overused and repetitive CSS Styling and was improved for better accessibility and readability. Naming convention for CSS classes were changed to better describe the HTML sections of which they are being used in. An Example below.

HTM alt tags within the img containers were added during the refactoring process.

Header links did not function properly and ID's were not set for sections 'assets' later on in the application. These were also included.
